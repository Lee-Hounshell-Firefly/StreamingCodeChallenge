Streaming URL Code Challenge App
================================

## Description

This is a coding challenge for a clean-architecture MVVM streaming URL capture app.
This app uses a service to continuously read JSON web log data.  Log data is placed into
a Mutable Live Data List for display in a RecyclerView.  Once 2000 entries are received,
the app will truncate the display list such that only the most recent 2000 items display.

From the Android Studio console, filter on "LEE:" to view the app's trace log.
